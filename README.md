# Physiological-Debt-Accumulation-Engine
A systems-level analysis engine that models sleep as a recovery debt process rather than a nightly outcome. Using physiological traits and ecological pressure signals, it estimates predicted sleep need, quantifies sleep debt, and visualizes how stress accumulates silently before visible fatigue or failure occurs.
